 * swfmill uses internal stylesheets for some commands ("simple").
 * these get big, so they are split into parts (*.xslt)
 * a .xml file (e.g. simple.xml) describes which parts should get assembled 
   to form a single internal sheet.
 * the .xml is transformed along assemble.xsl, including the parts,
   producing a .cpp that contains the stylesheet as a static string.

a new internal stylesheet (foo) would need:
 * foo.xml <compilation> description
 * ? anything else
 * mentions in Makefile.am
 * mention in xslt.h
 * command in swfmill.cpp
 
(PS, yes i know about xsl:import and :include, but i would have to hack
libxslt to read from something like memory:// urls, which is not nice either)
